Dear OpenAI Hiring Manager,

For over a decade, I built a career in Financial Markets. I was drawn by the impact and, yes, the compensation. Finance felt like the heart of every industry, reflecting global events in prices. But I've watched that heart start beating to a new rhythm. AI isn't just changing financial markets; it's redefining the core of every industry. I absolutely have to be where that fundamental shift is happening, not just watching it. This strong pull is why I'm applying for the Customer Success Manager position at OpenAI’s Seoul office.

Three years ago, ChatGPT burst onto the scene and genuinely amazed the world, me included. Now, with OpenAI launching its Seoul office, bringing that same groundbreaking innovation to a new market, I want to be the one who helps turn that initial amazement into a resounding "of course!" and "absolute conviction" for our Korean clients. My career has always been driven by a deep curiosity about how things work and how complex systems can be improved. Financial Markets offered a fascinating way of seeing the world. But AI, especially what OpenAI is doing, takes that satisfaction to a whole new level. It doesn't just reflect the world; it helps explain it and, more importantly, create new possibilities from what we observe. My real passion is helping others explore their own curiosities, especially when those discoveries unlock incredible value.

This role at OpenAI feels like a perfect fit, especially as you establish your presence in Korea. My 10 years in Financial Markets Sales & Structuring taught me how to truly connect with clients, understand their deepest needs, and navigate tricky relationships across all client types, from institutional to corporate. I am confident that few others possess such extensive client coverage and understanding of the Korean market landscape. With my Master of Computer and Information Technology and hands-on projects like AlphaWeaver, I bring a unique mix: the client-facing skills to build real trust and the technical understanding to truly grasp what your offerings can do. I'm not just here to manage accounts; I'm here to translate the 'why' and 'how' of AI into tangible success for your strategic partners.

Ultimately, the real magic of customer success happens long after the sale – it's about delivering ongoing satisfaction. This dedication to post-sales success is exactly my specialty. I'm ready, and incredibly motivated, to bring everything I've built in my career to ensure OpenAI's largest clients don't just use your technology, but truly thrive with it.

I've never switched jobs since I started my career, not because other opportunities didn't arise, but because none offered the true scope expansion I sought, regardless of the bank's size or reputation. This marks the very first time in 10 years that I'm writing a resume and cover letter, and it fills me with both nervousness and immense excitement. This drive comes from a profound passion to join OpenAI's Seoul office from its very beginning and be an integral part of shaping its foundation.

Thank you for considering someone who is eager to move from observing change to actively driving it. I'm excited for the chance to talk more.

Sincerely,

Yeong Hun (Luke) Lee
