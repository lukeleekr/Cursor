                    For over a decade, I've built a successful career in Financial Markets, drawn by the impact and the opportunity to reflect global events through market dynamics. Finance has always felt like the heart of every industry, but I've witnessed that heart start beating to a new rhythm. Technology isn't just changing financial markets; it's redefining the core of how businesses operate across all industries.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    My career has always been driven by a deep curiosity about how things work and how complex systems can be improved. Financial Markets offered a fascinating way of seeing the world, but technology takes that satisfaction to a whole new level. It doesn't just reflect the world; it helps explain it and, more importantly, create new possibilities from what we observe.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    With a Master's degree in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania and hands-on experience building quantitative trading algorithms, I bring a unique combination of financial markets expertise and technical understanding. My real passion is helping others explore their own curiosities, especially when those discoveries unlock incredible value.
